here are some mathematical topics I encountered in programming competitions:

Modular arithmetic, extended Euclid, Euler's totient function, Moebius function, Binomical coefficients, Bernoulli numbers, linear diophantine equations
Matrices, Gauss algorithm
Discrete probabilities, linearity of expectation, probability of conjunction of independent variables, distribution of order statistics.
Combinatorics, rule of sum/product, inclusion/exclusion principle, Burnside lemma, Gray code, Catalan numbers
Simple analitycal geometry (line intersection, line/circle intersection, inscribed circle), convex hull.
Recurrence relations, linear recurrences
Polynomials, fast Fourier transform
Hall's marriage theorem, Menger's theorem (graph problems in general tend to be math-heavy)
